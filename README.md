## A mod for EFT/SPT that simulates ear damage from gunfire and explosions

This mod simulates gunfire and explosions causing the ears to ring from gunfire and explosions. Along with that, this mod also takes into account ear protection and subsonic rounds
and makes it so that if you're wearing ear pro (or otherwise cannot wear ear pro), using a suppressor, or using subsonics, tinnitus won't trigger. Also, bots will cause tinnitus as well
and whether they have a suppressor or are using subsonics is also accounted for. Lastly, grenades not only cause tinnitus, but also causes contusion and distortion
with the strength depending on far you are from the grenade (which is calculated inversly using the distance). Also, I dare you to fire a .338 LM without ear pro or a suppressor.
